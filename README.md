# PASSWORD GENERATOR

Run the script from the command line or double click on it to generate a 30 character password.

The generated password will be copied to the clipboard automatically (on linux this requires `xclip` or `xsel` command to be installed).

By default the password is hidden, if you want to show it on the command line run the program passing the `-s` parameter.

By default the password will have a length of 30 characters, if you want to modify that length run the program passing the parameter `-l` followed by the desired number of characters.

The password will consist of symbols, numbers, and upper and lower case letters.

### Examples:

- Execute `password-generator` to generate a password of 30 characters and copy it to the clipboard without showing the result on the command line.

- Execute `password-generator -s` to generate a password of 30 characters, copy it to the clipboard and show the generated password on the command line.

- Execute `password-generator -l 55` to generate a password of 55 characters and copy it to the clipboard without showing the generated password on the command line.
